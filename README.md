# RayTracer

This was for a rendering algorithms course at UCSD, mostly ray tracing and associated algorithms and data structures.  This is not the latest version, I have been away from my tower, this is the only version I had on my laptop.  This version might need some editing to run correctly.


Later when I have access again to my tower, I will upload a clean VS17 version.

Later I will add CUDA and AVX SIMD to significantly decrease rendering time.
